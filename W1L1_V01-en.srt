00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,620
Welcome to CTL SC1x Fundamentals of Supply Chain

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,600
Management and Logistics.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,540
In this lecture, all I want to do

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,130
is introduce concepts of Supply Chain Management and Logistics,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,840
and set the stage for the remainder of the course.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,770
But first, let's talk about some supply

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,770
chains for a few different products.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,980
And so what I'm showing here are four very different products

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,770
that you would think have very different supply chains.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,920
And you'd be right.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,570
In the top left, we have bananas being

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,870
sold in a U.S. grocery store.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,350
On the right, we have an integrated ignition assembly.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,800
On the bottom right, we have women's pumps.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,510
On the bottom left, we have a bunch

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,290
of bags of cement-- of concrete.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,250
So if you look at these, you'd think, wow!

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,269
There's nothing that could be similar in these supply chains.

19
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,560
And the interesting thing about supply chain management

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,860
is that every product has a story,

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,500
and every product is part of multiple supply chains.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,630
So everything you touch-- and most things you don't-- flow

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,930
through some kind of supply chain somewhere in the world.

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,130
It's very, very rare where you can

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,050
think of an item that gets created, manufactured,

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,570
or grown, and consumed in the exact same place,

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,590
at the exact same time.

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,170
You need to have supply chains to overcome

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,430
the tyranny of time and space.

30
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,590
And that's what supply chains do.

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,889
But again, you look at these four very different products,

32
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,180
and what's interesting is there's a lot of similarities

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,560
you might not think about.

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,700
So if I look at the bananas up here in the top left,

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,050
and compare that to the shoes, you

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,780
can think about perishability.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,270
Because, yes, bananas will spoil over time,

38
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,720
but so will women's shoes.

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,820
Style is very fickle.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,940
So what's in for this season will not be in for too long.

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,030
So the idea of perishability, how long something

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,860
will stay fresh and able to be sold

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,310
at its normal standard price, is something

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,570
that is not just about fruit, it's

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,940
about many other fashion items.

46
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,000
Then you can think about sourcing.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,660
You don't have a lot of choice of where you can source cement,

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,150
or for where you can source bananas.

49
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,380
I can't grow bananas up here in Boston.

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,590
I could try in a greenhouse but it'd be very, very expensive.

51
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,120
You can't mine for cement where it doesn't already exist.

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,480
So sometimes your product is tied to a sourcing location

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,049
that you cannot change.

54
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,590
Then you could think of products that

55
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,000
are single-- individual items like bananas,

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,740
there's really only one part to the banana, or the cement--

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,260
while there are many chemicals you

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,850
might put in there as additives.

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,430
But you look at products like this ignition and the shoe.

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,100
They're made up of components.

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,850
And it could be that those components are not made by you,

62
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,960
but by someone else.

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,800
And therefore, you're part of a larger supply chain.

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,460
And finally, you can look at who you sell to.

65
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,640
For shoes, you're selling to a consumer.

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,610
A woman is probably buying these and, who knows, maybe a guy.

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,600
You never know.

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,830
So someone is buying this as a consumer.

69
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,000
Same thing with bananas.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,070
It's a B to C, a business to consumer, business.

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,710
For these ignition assemblies, it's

72
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,205
probably being sold to an auto manufacturer,

73
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:08,300
or an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM.

74
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,190
Same thing with these bags of cement.

75
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,550
Chances are it's being sold to a construction company.

76
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,430
So if I look at these four different products, what's

77
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,410
really interesting is that the same decisions

78
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,910
are being made by the people managing those supply

79
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,370
chains in each one of these products.

80
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,411
Now the values and the outcomes might differ,

81
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:28,910
but they're all making the decisions

82
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,030
of where can I source from?

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,010
How much inventory do I hold?

84
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,560
How do I forecast my demand?

85
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,310
Where do I stock my inventory?

86
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,470
How do I move my product from source to final consumption?

87
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,080
And all those kind of things.

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,600
And what we'll do in this course,

89
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,380
is discuss the concepts and methodologies

90
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,840
that will allow you to plan supply chains for products

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,430
as diverse as bananas, women shoes, automotive parts,

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,930
cement, and everything in between.

93
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,880
So what are we going to do in this lecture?

94
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Well, we're going to answer five big questions.

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,934
First is, what's a supply chain?

96
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,850
Then we're going to talk about the differences

97
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,360
between logistics and supply chain management.

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,900
Then we're going to talk about different perspectives of how

99
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,880
you can view supply chain management.

100
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,412
Because it's a very new and evolving field,

101
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,870
people have different perspectives,

102
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,410
and it helps you to understand those.

103
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,260
Finally, we'll talk about the challenges

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,980
that are faced in the supply chain.

105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,990
And then, finally, the last thing we'll do,

106
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,040
is why should you care?

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,390
All right, so let's get started.
